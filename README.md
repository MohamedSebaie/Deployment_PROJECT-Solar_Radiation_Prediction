## <font color='green'>Description of This File</font> 

### The dataset contains such columns as: `wind direction`, `wind speed`, `humidity` and `temperature`. 

### The response parameter that is to be predicted is: `Solar_radiation`. 
#### It contains measurements for the past 4 months and you have to `predict the level of solar radiation`.

## `Just imagine that you've got solar energy batteries and you want to know will it be reasonable to use them in future?`
